If the cross was the end of the story, we would have no hope. But the cross isn&lsquo;t the end. Jesus didn&lsquo;t escape from death; he conquered it and opened the way to heaven for all who will dare to believe. The truth of this moment, if we let it sweep over us, is stunning. It means Jesus really is who he claimed to be, we are really as lost as he said we are, and he really is the only way for us to intimately and spiritually connect with God again.&ldquo;
